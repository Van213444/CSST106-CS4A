**Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing**<br/>
<br/>
A category of artificial intelligence (AI) called computer vision focusses on allowing robots to read, comprehend, and interpret visual data from the environment. In order to extract useful information from photos or videos, computers must be trained to process and analyse them similarly to how people see their environment.<br/>
<br/>
Image processing refers to the methods and algorithms used to edit, manipulate, or analyse images in order to extract usable information or improve their quality. Through the processing of images, robots can better manage images that are noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete and use the processed data to make more accurate conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
**Types of Image Processing Techniques**<br/>
<br/>
Image Enhancement - Improves the visual quality of an image by adjusting brightness, contrast, sharpness, or noise reduction.<br/>
<br/>
Image Segmentation - Divides an image into multiple segments to isolate objects or regions of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Image Filtering - Applies filters (e.g., edge detection, blurring) to highlight or suppress certain features in an image.<br/>

**Case Study Overview**<br/>

A Smart Parking System: An IoT Based Computer Vision Approach for Free Parking Spot Detection Using Faster R-CNN with YOLOv3 Method<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, parking is much costlier and time consuming process in almost every big city, all over the world. The issue is that, the user couldn't find available parking space at time, and it found that cars may seek very limited parking space which causes severe traffic congestion. Thus, Smart parking systems are necessary to find the near term parking on demand. In this work, Smart Parking System is proposed to assign a free parking place for people, who need parking lot. This system will be able to process the images of parking area and its free slots in real-time, to notify user about all free slots which are available for parking. The user can choose the available parking lot as per their needs.<br/>
<br/>
**Your Image Processing Implementation**<br/>
<br/>
This Python script implements a system designed to detect and display available parking spots in real-time using computer vision. The process involves analyzing video frames from a parking lot, determining whether individual spots are occupied or vacant, and providing visual feedback on the status of each parking space. The code leverages OpenCV for image processing and video handling, as well as some utility functions for key tasks like identifying parking spot locations and determining their occupancy.<br/>

<br/>
**Conclusion**<br/>
<br/>
The ability to pre-process images, whether by enhancing contrast, segmenting important areas of interest, or applying filters to isolate important features, directly impacts the performance and accuracy of AI models. Image processing is a fundamental component in the success of AI applications, particularly in fields such as computer vision. This project on parking spot detection made the significance of image processing clear. Even in dynamic and unpredictably changing situations, the AI in the parking spot recognition system was able to distinguish between occupied and available parking places thanks to image processing. <br/>
